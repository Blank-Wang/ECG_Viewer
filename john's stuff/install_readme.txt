Program Description:
    ECG Viewer is a Matlab GUI for reviewing, processing, and annotating 
    electrocardiogram (ECG) data files. ECG Viewer offers an annotation database, 
    ECG filtering, beat detection using template matching, and inter-beat interval
    (IBI or RR) filtering. Program was created using Matlab 2008b.

How to Install:
    1. If you don't have MATLAB installed you will need to install the 
       MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR). Download and run MCRInstaller.exe.
    2. Before using the database features the first time you must create
       a datasourse in your Windows environment named "ann_db". See
       http://matlab.izmiran.ru/help/toolbox/database/instal12.html#18933.
       This is only done once. This datasource must point to your Access database file.
       Please use the annotations.mdb file supplied as a blank database and rename it if
       needed.
    3. Unzip the ECGViewer_install.zip package. Run ECG_Viewer.exe to open the ECG Viewer user interface.
